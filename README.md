# FORK NOTE
This is a special build of ReShade catered to NFS games made by EA Black Box.

It set to render before FrontEnd graphics, so the UI isn't affected by post-processing effects.

Also is included a special "NFS Tweaks" menu which contains a set of special and debugging features designed to manipulate the game in various ways (some of which are ported straight from the debug builds).

A LOT is left on the todo list, such as merging with the latest branch of ReShade and adding a bunch of more features, but the biggest one so far is getting dear imgui to render before FrontEnd.

## NFS Tweak Menu note
I must stress one caveat - this menu is not designed to babysit the user. It is designed to be a debug menu alternative.

By that I mean the features within the menu **can crash your game** and I will not consider this to be a bug. (Unless the implementation of the feature is wrong, which there will probably be cases of)

# ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION

ReShade
=======

This is a generic post-processing injector for games and video software. It exposes an automated way to access both frame color and depth information and a custom shader language called ReShade FX to write effects like ambient occlusion, depth of field, color correction and more which work everywhere.

The ReShade FX shader compiler contained in this repository is standalone, so can be integrated into other projects as well. Simply add all `source/effect_*.*` files to your project and use it similar to the [fxc example](tools/fxc.cpp).

## Building

You'll need Visual Studio 2017 or higher to build ReShade and Python for the `gl3w` dependency.

1. Clone this repository including all Git submodules
2. Open the Visual Studio solution
3. Select either the `32-bit` or `64-bit` target platform and build the solution.\
   This will build ReShade and all dependencies. To build the setup tool, first build the `Release` configuration for both `32-bit` and `64-bit` targets and only afterwards build the `Release Setup` configuration (does not matter which target is selected then).
